# NF0301: Method has no factory operation attribute

## Description

A public method in a factory class does not have any factory operation attribute (`[Create]`, `[Fetch]`, `[Insert]`, `[Update]`, `[Delete]`, or `[Execute]`) and will not be included in factory generation.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Diagnostic ID** | NF0301 |
| **Severity** | Info |
| **Category** | RemoteFactory.Configuration |
| **Default** | **Disabled** (opt-in) |

## Enabling This Diagnostic

This diagnostic is disabled by default to avoid noise. Enable it via `.editorconfig` when debugging:

```ini
[*.cs]
dotnet_diagnostic.NF0301.severity = suggestion
```

Or for a specific project:

```ini
[src/MyProject/**/*.cs]
dotnet_diagnostic.NF0301.severity = suggestion
```

## Example

With NF0301 enabled, the following code triggers the diagnostic:

```csharp
[Factory]
public partial class Customer
{
    [Create]
    public Customer() { }

    // Info NF0301: No factory attribute, method will be skipped
    public void HelperMethod()
    {
        // This helper method won't be in the factory
    }

    // Info NF0301: No factory attribute, method will be skipped
    public bool Validate()
    {
        return Name != null;
    }

    public string Name { get; set; }
}
```

## How to Fix

**Option 1: Add the appropriate factory attribute**

If the method should be included in factory generation:

```csharp
[Factory]
public partial class Customer
{
    [Create]
    public Customer() { }

    // Now included in factory as a Fetch operation
    [Fetch]
    public static Customer LoadFromCache()
    {
        return _cache.Get<Customer>();
    }
}
```

**Option 2: Keep as non-factory method**

If the method is intentionally not a factory operation (e.g., domain logic, helpers), you can:

1. **Ignore the diagnostic** - It's just informational
2. **Make the method private or internal** - NF0301 only reports on public methods
3. **Suppress it** - See suppression options below

## Suppressing This Diagnostic

Since it's opt-in and informational, you typically just disable it in `.editorconfig`:

```ini
[*.cs]
dotnet_diagnostic.NF0301.severity = none
```

Or suppress it inline for specific methods:

```csharp
#pragma warning disable NF0301
public void IntentionallyNotAFactoryMethod()
{
    // Domain logic here
}
#pragma warning restore NF0301
```

## When to Use This Diagnostic

Enable NF0301 when:

1. **Debugging** - "Why isn't my method being generated?"
2. **Code review** - Ensuring all factory methods have proper attributes
3. **Onboarding** - Helping new team members understand which methods are factory operations

## What Triggers This Diagnostic

NF0301 is reported for methods that:

- Are in a class with `[Factory]` attribute
- Are `public`
- Are regular methods (not constructors, not property accessors)
- Are not compiler-generated
- Do NOT have any factory operation attribute

NF0301 is NOT reported for:

- Private or internal methods
- Constructors (even public ones without `[Create]`)
- Property getters/setters
- Compiler-generated methods (like `ToString` from records)

# NF0104: Hint name truncated - potential collision risk

## Description

The fully qualified name of a type exceeds the configured hint name length limit. The name was truncated, which may cause collisions with other types that have the same class name in different namespaces.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Diagnostic ID** | NF0104 |
| **Severity** | Error |
| **Category** | RemoteFactory.Usage |
| **Default** | Enabled |

## Example

The following code triggers NF0104 with the default limit of 50 characters:

```csharp
namespace MyCompany.MyProduct.MyModule.MySubModule
{
    [Factory]
    public partial class Customer
    {
        [Create]
        public static Customer Create() => new Customer();
    }
}
```

The fully qualified name `MyCompany.MyProduct.MyModule.MySubModule.Customer` (53 characters) exceeds the 50-character limit and would be truncated to `MyModule.MySubModule.Customer`.

## Why This Matters

Roslyn source generators use "hint names" for generated files. These names must be unique. When truncation occurs:

1. `Company.Product.ModuleA.Customer` might truncate to `Customer`
2. `Company.Product.ModuleB.Customer` might also truncate to `Customer`
3. Both would try to generate `CustomerFactory.g.cs`, causing a build failure

The generator reports this error proactively to prevent cryptic "duplicate hint name" errors from Roslyn.

## How to Fix

### Option 1: Increase the Hint Name Length Limit

Add an assembly-level attribute to increase the limit:

```csharp
using Neatoo.RemoteFactory;

[assembly: FactoryHintNameLength(100)]
```

Choose a value slightly larger than your longest fully qualified type name.

### Option 2: Shorten Namespace or Class Names

Refactor to use shorter names:

```csharp
// Before
namespace MyCompany.MyProduct.MyModule.MySubModule
{
    public partial class CustomerDataTransferObject { }
}

// After
namespace MyCompany.MyProduct.Customers
{
    public partial class CustomerDto { }
}
```

## Path Length Considerations

Windows has a 254-character limit for file paths. The generated file path includes:
- Project output directory
- Generator folders: `Neatoo.RemoteFactory.FactoryGenerator/`
- Hint name: `YourTypeName`
- Suffix: `Factory.g.cs`

If you're hitting path length issues, consider:
- Moving your project closer to the drive root
- Enabling long path support in Windows
- Using shorter hint names (the default 50 is conservative)

# NF0101: Class must be partial for factory generation

## Description

Static classes that contain `[Execute]` methods must be declared as `partial` so the source generator can add the delegate definitions.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Diagnostic ID** | NF0101 |
| **Severity** | Error |
| **Category** | RemoteFactory.Usage |
| **Default** | Enabled |

## Example

The following code triggers NF0101:

```csharp
// Error NF0101: Missing 'partial' keyword
[Factory]
public static class MyCommands
{
    [Execute]
    public static Task<string> RunOnServer(string message)
    {
        return Task.FromResult($"Processed: {message}");
    }
}
```

## How to Fix

Add the `partial` modifier to the class declaration:

```csharp
// Correct: Class is partial
[Factory]
public static partial class MyCommands
{
    [Execute]
    public static Task<string> RunOnServer(string message)
    {
        return Task.FromResult($"Processed: {message}");
    }
}
```

## Why This Matters

The RemoteFactory source generator needs to add generated code (delegate definitions and service registrations) to your class. This is only possible with partial classes, which allow multiple source files to contribute to a single class definition.

Without the `partial` keyword, the compiler would treat any generated code as a duplicate class definition, causing compilation errors.

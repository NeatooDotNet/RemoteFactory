# NF0103: Execute method requires static class

## Description

Methods marked with `[Execute]` must be static methods in a static class. The Execute pattern is designed for stateless remote procedure calls.

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Diagnostic ID** | NF0103 |
| **Severity** | Error |
| **Category** | RemoteFactory.Usage |
| **Default** | Enabled |

## Example

The following code triggers NF0103:

```csharp
// Error NF0103: Class is not static
[Factory]
public partial class MyCommands
{
    [Execute]
    public Task<string> RunOnServer(string message)
    {
        return Task.FromResult($"Processed: {message}");
    }
}
```

## How to Fix

Make both the class and the method static:

```csharp
// Correct: Static class with static method
[Factory]
public static partial class MyCommands
{
    [Execute]
    public static Task<string> RunOnServer(string message)
    {
        return Task.FromResult($"Processed: {message}");
    }
}
```

## Why This Matters

The Execute pattern is specifically designed for stateless remote procedure calls (RPCs). Unlike factory operations like `[Create]` or `[Fetch]` which work with domain objects, Execute operations are standalone commands or queries.

Key characteristics of Execute operations:
- **Stateless**: No instance state to manage
- **Self-contained**: All required data is passed as parameters
- **Service-based**: Dependencies are injected via `[Service]` parameters

If you need to work with domain objects, consider using `[Fetch]`, `[Create]`, `[Insert]`, `[Update]`, or `[Delete]` instead.

## Alternative: Interface Factory Execute

If you need Execute-style methods on an interface, use the interface factory pattern:

```csharp
[Factory]
public interface IMyService
{
    [Execute]
    Task<string> RunOnServer(string message);
}
```

Interface factories handle Execute differently and don't require static classes.

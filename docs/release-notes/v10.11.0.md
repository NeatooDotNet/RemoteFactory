# v10.11.0 - Generator Refactoring

**Release Date:** 2026-01-15
**NuGet:** [Neatoo.RemoteFactory 10.11.0](https://nuget.org/packages/Neatoo.RemoteFactory/10.11.0)

## Overview

Major internal refactoring of the source generator to a Code Model + Renderer architecture, improving maintainability and enabling future enhancements. Also includes a bug fix for exception stack trace preservation.

## What's New

### Generator Architecture Improvements

The source generator has been refactored from a mixed model/rendering approach to a clean Code Model + Renderer pattern:

- **FactoryModelBuilder** transforms syntax analysis results into domain-specific models
- **Renderers** (ClassFactoryRenderer, InterfaceFactoryRenderer, StaticFactoryRenderer) emit code from models
- Clear separation of concerns makes the generator easier to maintain and extend

This is an internal change with no impact on generated code behavior.

## Breaking Changes

None.

## Bug Fixes

### Exception Stack Trace Preservation

Remote method exceptions now preserve the original stack trace instead of wrapping in `TargetInvocationException`. When a domain method throws an exception during a remote call, the original exception is now re-thrown with its stack trace intact.

**Before:** Exceptions from remote calls were wrapped in `TargetInvocationException`, obscuring the original stack trace.

**After:** The original exception is re-thrown using `ExceptionDispatchInfo.Capture().Throw()`, preserving the full stack trace for easier debugging.

## Commits

- refactor: complete Code Model + Renderer pattern integration
- fix: preserve exception stack traces in remote method calls

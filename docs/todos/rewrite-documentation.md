## Problem

RemoteFactory documentation was removed and needs to be completely rewritten. The project needs comprehensive documentation that helps expert .NET developers understand and adopt the framework.

## Solution

Use the two-agent documentation workflow:
1. **docs-architect**: Create documentation structure with MarkdownSnippets placeholders
2. **docs-code-samples**: Create compilable sample projects that fill the placeholders

Documentation will target expert .NET developers and follow the standard C# framework structure.

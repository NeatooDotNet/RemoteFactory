## Scope

Expose the public `IFactoryEventPhaseCoordinator` with `DrainAsync(DispatchPhase, ct)` so a
consumer's transaction abstraction can drain the `AfterFlush` queue between its outermost
flush and commit, and implement the fail-open fallback: `AfterFlush` handlers never drained
by the consumer run at the `AfterCommit` point with a logged warning. Includes the
cross-phase ordering guarantee tests (all `Immediate` before any `AfterFlush` before any
`AfterCommit`). This plan does NOT add transaction awareness to the framework — the
coordinator is a drain trigger, nothing more.
